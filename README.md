For mastermind, I was way more focued on the structure of the code. Which I feel I managed and it payed of. It was way easier to navigate the code, even if I hadn't touched it in some time.

I felt most of this task was quite simple and relatively easy to do. However, for some reason, I could never get the colors to work. I came close once when I figured out that the ANSI codes I wanted to use ranged from 0-9. With the input being 0-9, I figured I could use that to determine the color output. Until I realized it would not solve the issue. The issue being that in the evalutaion, 1 == green e.g.. 

Another thing I struggled with was the output window in general. Having it display the amount of tries until the amount was reached, while also being the same output was something I did not manage to do. I seems like such a simple task, but I could never figure it out. My thought process was to have one array that shows the attemps, and then replacing array[0] by the attempt. Then increase it until the whole array is filled with attemps.
